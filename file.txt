do good and throw it into the water
create without thinking that maybe
they will reward you for that good
throw it into the river nothing more
the river will take him to the sea
to sweeten the sea slightly
to make a good steam rise
to heaven bringing your generous gift
to fill the sky with goodness
and welcome to come out in the rain
the fields and the soul were spille
do good and throw it into the water
